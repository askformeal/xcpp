## Requirements:

This software only works on Windows System. I might create a Linux Version later.

You'll have to install gcc compiler to use this software, open CMD and enter "g++ --version" to check if you already have it.

If you want to compile the source code of v1.0.0 or v1.1.0 yourself, make you sure you can use the "bits/stdc++.h" header file.

## Features:

Run cpp file with a single command

Program running timing

Automatically delete the .exe file after run it

No complex installation needed

----
## How to install:

If you downloaded the .exe file, copy it into C:\Windows\System32.

If you downloaded the .cpp file, you'll have to compile it yourself and make sure the generated .exe file is named "xgcc.exe" and then copy it into C:\Windows\System32.
